# Nila-ML-Projects

These are some of the sample AI and ML projects that I have explored and practiced.

To try out these examples, use `conda` 

### Step 1: Create your project workspace

```
mkdir myworkspace
cd myworkspace
```
### Step 2: Create your conda environment with required libraries

```
conda create --prefix ./env pandas numpy jupyter boto3
conda env list
conda activate ./env
```
### Step 3: Start jupyter notebook

```
jupyter notebook
```

These steps should launch `jupyter notebook` on your local - http://localhost:8888/tree 
You can either download these `.ipynb` files and upload them to jupyter notebook to run all cells.
